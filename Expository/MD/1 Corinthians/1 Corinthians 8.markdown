# 1 Corinthians 8 
## THE CONFUSION (8:4a): 
## THE CLARIFICATION (8:4b-6, 8) 
###  There are many idols, all of which represent gods who do not exist (8:4b-5). 
###  There is only one true God, the creator of all things and the giver of life (8:6). 
###  In light of the above, there is no connection between food and spirituality (8:8). 
## THE CONCERN (8:7): 
## THE CHALLENGE (8:1-3, 9-12) 
###  Don\'t become a stumbling block to other Christians (8:9-12). 
####  To do so is to sin against your weaker brother (8:9-11). 
####  To do so is to sin against your Savior (8:12). 
###  Do become a stepping-stone (8:1-3): 
## THE CONCLUSION (8:13):

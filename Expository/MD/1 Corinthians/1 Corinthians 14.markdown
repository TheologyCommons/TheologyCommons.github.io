####  It strengthens, encourages, and comforts believers (14:3). 
####  It edifies the entire church (14:4b). 
####  It is Paul\'s personal choice for the Corinthian church (14:5). 
####  It is Paul\'s most effective way to help all the churches (14:6).

####  From the daily world (14:9-12): 
###  The admonitions concerning this gift (14:29-33) 
####  Only two or three people should prophesy in a service, and the others should evaluate what is said (14:29). 
####  If one person is prophesying and another receives a divine revelation, the first person should allow the second to speak (14:30-31). 
####  Those who prophesy must remain in control of their spirit so that they can wait their turn to speak (4:32-33). 
## THE GIFT OF TONGUES (14:2, 4a, 13-17, 21-25, 27-35) 
###  The reasons for this gift (14:2, 4a, 21-25) 
####  In regard to believers (14:2, 4a) 
#####  The speaker utters mysteries to God that are unknown to man (14:2). 
#####  The speaker edifies himself (14:4a). 
####  In regard to unbelievers (14:21-25) 
#####  The prediction (14:21): 
#####  The purpose (14:22): 
#####  The problem (14:23): 
#####  The persuasion (14:24-25): 
###  The rules governing this gift (14:13-17, 27-32, 34-35) 
####  Those speaking in tongues should pray that what is said might be correctly interpreted (14:1314). 
####  The one praying and singing with his spirit is also to do both with his mind (14:15-17). 
####  No more than two or three should speak in tongues at any service (14:27a). 
####  They should speak one at a time (14:27b). 
####  Someone must be present to interpret, or they should keep quiet (14:27c-28). 
####  Women are not to speak in tongues or prophesy in the church meetings (14:34-35). 
## THE GUIDELINES FOR BOTH GIFTS (14:20, 33, 36-40): 
###  Be as innocent as infants and as intelligent as adults in exercising these gifts (14:20). 
###  These gifts and all others should be used solely for the edification of others (14:26). 
###  Be eager to prophesy, and don\'t forbid tongues (14:39). 
###  Do everything in a fitting and orderly way (14:33, 40). 
###  Obey what Paul has written, for these are God\'s commands (14:36-38).

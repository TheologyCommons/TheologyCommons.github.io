# 1 Corinthians 7
## MARRIAGE-SOME GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS (7:1-2, 7-9, 17-24, 29-35) 
###  The argument (7:1-2, 7-9, 32-35): 
####  The advantages of marriage (7:2, 7, 9) 
#####  It helps prevent immoral actions and attitudes (7:2, 9). 
#####  It is God\'s will for many people to marry (7:7). 
####  The advantages of remaining single (7:1, 8, 32-35): 
###  The answer (7:17-24, 29-31): 
####  God\'s will must govern any decisions concerning marriage (7:17). 
####  Pleasing God is the supreme objective (7:18-19). 
####  We are not our own but have been bought and paid for by Christ (7:20-24). 
####  Even if married, Christ must occupy first place in our life (7:29-31). 
## MARRIAGE-SOME SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS: (7:3-6, 10-16, 25-28, 36-40): Paul now addresses four groups. 
###  Saved couples (7:3-6, 10-11) 
####  Both are to submit their bodies to each other (7:3-4). 
####  Both must agree if physical intimacy is set aside for a while to facilitate prayer and fasting (7:5-6). 
####  Both must strive to stay together and not divorce (7:10-11). 
###  Spiritually mixed couples (7:12-16) 
####  The saved spouse should continue living with the unsaved spouse if possible (7:12-13). 
####  This action may result in the salvation of the unsaved spouse (7:14). 
####  The saved spouse should allow the unsaved spouse to depart if he or she insists on it (7:1516). 
###  Virgins (7:25-28, 36-38):

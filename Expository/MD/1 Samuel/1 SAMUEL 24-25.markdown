# 1 SAMUEL 24-25 
## DAVID\'S MERCY TOWARD SAUL (24:1-22): This is the first of two occasions when David could easily kill Saul but does not do so. 
###  The resumption (24:1-2): After routing the Philistines, Saul once again continues his relentless hunt for David. 
###  The realization (24:3-4): David\'s men, hiding in the cave, realize that there is an opportunity to kill Saul, who has entered the cave to relieve himself. 
###  The restraint (24:4-7): David does not kill Saul but cuts off a piece of Saul\'s robe without the king knowing it. 
###  The rebuke (24:8-15): After Saul leaves the cave, David calls out to him and bows low before him, showing him the piece of robe he cut off. David uses this to prove that he is not seeking Saul\'s harm, because he could have killed him if he had wanted to. David asks Saul why he continues to chase him. 
###  The remorse (24:16-19): Saul becomes ashamed and acknowledges that David is a better man than he. 
###  The realization (24:20-22): Saul also acknowledges that God has indeed chosen David to be king over Israel! 
## DAVID\'S MARRIAGE TO ABIGAIL (25:1-44): Samuel soon dies, and David moves to the wilderness of Maon. 
###  David and Nabal (25:1-13) 
####  The request (25:1-9): David asks a wealthy man named Nabal to repay past kindness toward him by giving David\'s men some provisions. 
####  The refusal (25:10-12): Nabal sharply denies this request. 
####  The retaliation (25:13): David becomes angry and plans to punish Nabal. 
###  David and Abigail (25:14-44) 
####  The wise woman (25:14-35): Nabal\'s servants tell his wife, Abigail, about the incident and warn her that David is coming. 
#####  Her appeal to David (25:14-31): Abigail prepares a large supply of food and rides out to meet David, pleading with him not to kill her husband. 
#####  Her acceptance by David (25:32-35): David thanks God for sending Abigail to him and agrees not to harm Nabal. 
####  The widowed woman (25:36-38): After a night of heavy drinking, Nabal is told by Abigail about the terrible danger he had been in; he suffers a stroke. Ten days later the Lord strikes him and he dies. 
####  The wedded woman (25:39-44): Following Nabal\'s death, David asks Abigail to become his wife, and she accepts.

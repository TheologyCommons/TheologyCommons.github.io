# 1 SAMUEL 18-19 
## THE FURY OF SAUL (18:1-19:17): Saul becomes jealous of David and tries to kill him. 
###  David\'s rise (18:1-7): After David\'s victory over Goliath, David gains great favor in the eyes of others. 
####  With the prince (18:1-4): Jonathan, Saul\'s son, becomes David\'s closest and most beloved friend. 
####  With the people (18:5-7): After David\'s victory the people sing, \"Saul has killed his thousands, and David his ten thousands!\" 
###  Saul\'s rage (18:8-19:17): David\'s popularity makes Saul angry and jealous. He attempts to kill David five times-all are unsuccessful. 
####  First and second attempts (18:10-16): Twice Saul hurls a spear at David as he plays his harp. 
####  Third attempt (18:17-30): Twice Saul offers one of his daughters in marriage to David if he proves himself by fighting the Philistines. Instead of being killed, David kills 200 Philistines and gains Michal as his bride. 
####  Fourth attempt (19:1-10) 
#####  The truce (19:1-8): As a result of Jonathan\'s pleas, Saul promises to no longer seek David\'s death. 
#####  The treachery (19:9-10): Soon a tormenting spirit comes upon Saul; he tries again to kill David with a spear! 
####  Fifth attempt (19:11-17) 
#####  Saul\'s intention (19:11): Saul sends men to kill David when David leaves his house one morning. 
#####  Michal\'s intervention (19:11-17): David\'s wife, Michal, tells David of the plot and helps him escape through a window. She places an idol in his bed to fool the men and gain more time for David to escape. 
## THE FLIGHT FROM SAUL (19:18-24) 
###  David\'s message (19:18): David goes to Ramah and tells Samuel how Saul is trying to kill him. 
###  Saul\'s men (19:19-24): Three times Saul sends men to arrest David, but each time the men are overcome by the Spirit of God and begin to prophesy. Finally, Saul himself goes, and the same thing happens to him!

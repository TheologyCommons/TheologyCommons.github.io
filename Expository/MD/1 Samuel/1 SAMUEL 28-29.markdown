# 1 SAMUEL 28-29 
## THE MEDIUM (28:1-25): Saul visits a spirit medium in the city of Endor. 
###  The reason (28:1-8) 
####  Saul\'s desperation (28:1-6): The Philistines are threatening to attack the Israelites. Samuel has died, so Saul no longer has anyone to counsel him. When he asks the Lord for answers, he is not given any response. 
####  Saul\'s decision (28:7): To allay his fears, Saul seeks help from a spirit medium. 
####  Saul\'s disguise (28:8): Before he goes to visit the medium, Saul dresses in ordinary clothes so he will not be recognized, for he has banned all mediums from Israel. 
###  The results (28:9-25) 
####  The calling up of Samuel (28:9-14): When the medium asks Saul whom he wants to speak with, he tells her to summon the spirit of Samuel. 
#####  The medium\'s dread (28:12-13): The woman is fearful upon recognizing Saul and seeing Samuel come out of the earth! 
#####  The medium\'s description (28:14): She describes Samuel as \"an old man wrapped in a robe.\" 
####  The condemnation by Samuel (28:15-19) 
#####  Samuel reviews Saul\'s terrible past (28:15-18): Samuel tells Saul that he has lost his kingdom to David because he failed to completely destroy the Amalekites. 
#####  He previews Saul\'s tragic future (28:19): Samuel tells Saul that his army will be defeated by the Philistines and that he and his sons will be killed. 
####  The cowering by Saul (28:20-25): At Samuel\'s words, Saul falls on the ground, paralyzed with fright. Eventually the medium convinces him to eat something before he leaves. 
## THE MISTRUST (29:1-1 1) 
###  The desire (29:1-3): David volunteers to join with the Philistines in fighting against Saul\'s army. 
###  The denial (29:4-11): Some of the Philistine leaders mistrust David, fearing he will turn against them during battle. So King Achish sends David back to the land of the Philistines.

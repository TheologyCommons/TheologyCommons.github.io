# 1 SAMUEL 30-31 
## DAVID\'S VENGEANCE (30:1-31) 
###  The sorrow (30:1-8) 
####  The destruction (30:1-5): While David and his men are gone, the Amalekites destroy Ziklag and carry off its citizens, including David\'s two wives. 
####  The distress (30:6): David\'s men threaten to kill him for allowing this to happen. 
####  The direction (30:7-8): The Lord orders David to attack the enemy, assuring him of victory. 
###  The success (30:9-20): David mobilizes his men and attacks the Amalekites. 
####  Two hundred exhausted men (30:9-10): As David and his men cross Besor Brook, 200 of his men are too tired to continue; only 400 men press on to fight the Amalekites. 
####  One Egyptian man (30:11-16): David\'s men find an Egyptian slave who had been left behind by the Amalekites. The man agrees to take David to the Amalekites\' camp. 
####  Four hundred energized men (30:17-20): David\'s men attack the camp and destroy the Amalekites, recovering all the captives and goods that had been taken. 
###  The sharing (30:21-31): David distributes the plunder among two groups: 
####  The soldiers of Israel (30:21-25) 
#####  Their objection (30:21-22): The 400 soldiers object to sharing the plunder with the 200 who stayed behind. 
#####  His ordinance (30:23-25): David insists that the plunder be shared with those who guard the equipment as well as with those who fight. 
####  The leaders of Judah (30:26-31): The leaders of several towns of Judah also receive a portion of the plunder. 
## THE PHILISTINES\' VICTORY (31:1-13): When the Philistines attack the Israelites, Saul and his sons are killed on the battlefield, just as Samuel foretold. 
###  The method (31:1-6): On Mount Gilboa, Saul\'s sons are killed, and Saul is critically wounded by the Philistines. He falls on his own sword to avoid capture and abuse by the enemy. 
###  The mutilation (31:7-10): The Philistines cut off Saul\'s head and fasten his body to the wall of the city of Beth-shan.

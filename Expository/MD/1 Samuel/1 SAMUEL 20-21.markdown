# 1 SAMUEL 20-21 
## DAVID AND THE PRINCE (20:1-42): David finds Jonathan and tells him of Saul\'s determination to kill him. Jonathan devises a plan to find out if this is true and warn David. 
###  The cause of David\'s fears (20:1-23) 
####  The problem (20:1-11): In spite of Jonathan\'s attempts to reassure him, David is convinced that Saul is still trying to kill him. 
####  The promise (20:12-17): Jonathan promises to warn David about his father\'s plans, and both men make a sacred vow to be loyal to each other, whatever the cost. 
####  The plan (20:18-23): On the new moon festival David will hide in a field. The next day Jonathan will warn him by a prearranged signal. He will shoot arrows and tell a servant to go fetch them. If he tells the servant to go farther, David will know that Saul is planning to kill him. 
###  The confirmation of David\'s fears (20:24-42) 
####  David\'s absence (20:24-29): At the new moon festival Saul notices that David is not present at the meal. Jonathan makes up the excuse that David has gone to Bethlehem to take part in a family sacrifice. 
####  Saul\'s anger (20:30-34): A furious Saul not only states his intention to kill David but actually attempts to murder Jonathan for befriending him! 
####  Jonathan\'s arrows (20:35-42): In accordance with their plan, Jonathan shoots some arrows to warn David. So David meets with Jonathan one final time to affirm his loyalty and say goodbye before he leaves. 
## DAVID AND THE PRIEST (21:1-9): David goes to the city of Nob to see Ahimelech the priest. 
###  The falsehood (21:1-2): David tells the priest that Saul has sent him on a private mission. 
###  The favor (21:3-9): The priest provides David with holy bread and offers him Goliath\'s sword. 
## DAVID AND THE PAGAN (21:10-15): David seeks refuge from Saul in the Philistine city of Gath. He fears what the king of Gath might do to him, so he pretends to be insane.

# 1 SAMUEL 8-11 
## THE ASKING (8:1-22): Israel asks Samuel for a king. 
###  The logic (8:1-5): The people request a king because Samuel is old, his sons are corrupt, and the surrounding nations have kings. 
###  The lamentation (8:6-9): This request upsets Samuel, but the Lord assures him that the people are rejecting God, not him. 
###  The liabilities (8:10-22): Samuel explains the consequences of allowing a king to rule over them. 
####  The review (8:10-18): A king will force military service and slave labour upon their sons and daughters and impose heavy taxes on them. 
####  The refusal (8:19-22): In spite of Samuel\'s warning, the people still demand a king! 
## THE ACQUISITION (9:1-27): Samuel acquires a king for Israel, a man named Saul. 
###  The person (9:1-2): The Lord chooses Saul to become the first king of Israel. Saul is a tall, handsome man from the tribe of Benjamin. 
###  The particulars (9:3-27) 
####  The mission of Saul (9:3-13) 
#####  The search (9:3-5): Saul is sent by his father to locate some donkeys that have strayed; he does not find them. 
#####  The suggestion (9:6-13): One of Saul\'s servants advises him to ask a seer concerning the whereabouts of the lost donkeys. 
####  The message to Samuel (9:14-16): In the meantime, the Lord tells Samuel that he is sending a man from the tribe of Benjamin to become Israel\'s first king. 
####  The meeting of both (9:17-27): As Saul approaches Samuel to ask where the seer lives, the Lord tells Samuel that this is the man who will be king. 
#####  Samuel\'s assurance (9:17-20): Samuel tells Saul that the missing donkeys have been found and that he is the focus of Israel\'s hopes! 
#####  Saul\'s amazement (9:21): Saul finds this difficult to believe, pointing out that he comes from an unimportant family from Benjamin, Israel\'s smallest tribe. 
#####  Saul\'s actions (9:22-27): Samuel prepares a meal for Saul and his servants and specially honours him. Later Samuel makes accommodations for Saul and sends him on his way. 
## THE ANOINTING (10:1-27): just before Saul leaves, Samuel anoints him as the next king of Israel. 
###  The proof (10:1-9): Samuel anoints Saul and tells him that several signs will demonstrate that he has indeed been chosen as Israel\'s king. These signs are fulfilled after Saul leaves Samuel: 
####  The message of two men (10:2): Two men will tell Saul that the donkeys have been found and that his father is worried about him. 
####  The meal of three men (10:3-4): Three men will offer Saul two loaves of bread. 
####  The music of some prophets (10:5): Saul will meet some prophets coming down from a hill and playing music. 
####  The ministry of the Spirit (10:6): The Spirit of the Lord will come upon Saul and cause him to prophesy with the prophets. 
###  The proverb (10:10-12): Saul\'s prophetic experience so amazes his friends that they create a proverbial expression \"Is Saul a prophet?\" 
###  The placating (10:13-16): When Saul returns from his trip, his uncle asks him where he has been. Saul tells him that he went to see Samuel and that the donkeys have been found, but he does not mention being anointed king of Israel. 
###  The presentation (10:17-24): At Mizpah Samuel introduces Saul to the people as their king, although Saul must be brought out from his hiding place among the baggage! 
###  The parchment (10:25): Samuel writes the king\'s responsibilities in a book and deposits it in the Tabernacle. 
###  The positions (10:26-27): Some support Saul and become his constant companions; others oppose him and refuse to bring him gifts. 
## THE AFFIRMATION (11:1-15): Through military victory and a second coronation, Saul\'s kingship is affirmed. 
###  The crisis (11: 1-11) 
####  The demand (11:1-2): A cruel Ammonite king named Nahash surrounds the Israelite town of Jabesh-gilead. When the people ask for a peace treaty, he demands they allow him to gouge out the right eye of every citizen! 
####  The desperation (11:3): The elders ask for seven days to see if they can find someone to rescue them. 
####  The decree (11:4-10): Upon learning of this, a furious and Spirit-filled Saul sends out a call to arms and gathers an army to fight against Nahash. 
####  The deliverance (11:11): Saul and his army destroy Nahash\'s forces and save Jabesh-gilead. 
###  The confirmation (11:12-15): Saul has now proven his ability to reign and is reconfirmed as king by Samuel and the people at Gilgal.

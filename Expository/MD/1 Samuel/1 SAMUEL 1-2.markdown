###  Her spouse (1:1-2): Hannah is married to Elkanah. 
###  Her sorrow (1:3-8): Hannah is heartbroken because she does not have any children. 
####  Reassurance by Elkanah (1:4-5, 8): Elkanah tries to comfort Hannah, reminding her of his love and devotion to her. 
####  Ridicule by Peninnah (1:6-7): Elkanah\'s other wife, Peninnah, taunts Hannah because she has no children. 
###  Her supplication (1:9-18) 
####  The promise (1:9-11): Hannah visits the Tabernacle and prays that if the Lord will give her a son, she will give him back to the Lord. 
####  The protest (1:12-16) 
#####  Eli\'s condemnation (1:12-14): When the priest Eli sees Hannah praying, he wrongly concludes that she is drunk. 
#####  Hannah\'s clarification (1:15-16): Hannah quickly explains that she is praying to the Lord out of great anguish and sorrow. 
####  The prayer (1:17-18): Eli asks the Lord to grant Hannah\'s request. Hannah rejoices over Eli\'s prayer. 
###  Her son (1:19-28; 2:11, 18-20, 26): The Lord honors Hannah\'s request, and she gives birth to Samuel. Hannah dedicates Samuel to the Lord and leaves him at the Tabernacle after he is weaned. She visits Samuel yearly, making a coat for him each year and watching him grow. 
###  Her song (2:1-11): In this remarkable prayer, Hannah praises the Lord for his holiness, his omniscience, his sovereignty, his compassion, and his justice. 
###  Her sons and daughters (2:21): The Lord blesses Hannah with three more sons and two daughters. 
## THE FAMILY OF ELI (2:12-17, 22-25, 27-36): Eli the priest has two wicked sons, Hophni and Phinehas. 
###  Their wickedness (2:12-17, 22) 
####  They are guilty of impiety (2:12, 17). 
####  They are guilty of intimidation (2:13-16). 
####  They are guilty of immorality (2:22). 
###  Their warning (2:23-25, 27-36) 
####  From the parent (2:23-25): Eli attempts to correct his rebellious sons, but it is too late. 
####  From the prophet (2:27-36): Finally a prophet warns Eli of the consequences of his family\'s behavior: They will no longer serve as priests, and Eli\'s two sons will die on the same day.

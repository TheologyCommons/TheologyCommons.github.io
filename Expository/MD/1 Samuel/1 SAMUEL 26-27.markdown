# 1 SAMUEL 26-27 
## DAVID FOREGOES (26:1-25): David chooses not to take advantage of a second opportunity to kill Saul. 
###  The constraint (26:1-11): David and Abishai sneak into Saul\'s camp late one night. 
####  The request (26:7-8): Abishai asks David\'s permission to kill the sleeping king with his own spear! 
####  The refusal (26:9-11): David refuses, saying that Saul is still God\'s anointed one. 
###  The call (26:12-16): David and Abishai leave, taking Saul\'s spear and water jug. From a safe distance, David wakes his enemies by shouting insults at Abner (Saul\'s general) for sleeping on the job! 
###  The criticism (26:17-20): David asks Saul why he continues to pursue him when David has not harmed him. 
###  The confession (26:21-25): Saul confesses that he has wronged David and tells him that he will no longer try to harm him. 
## DAVID FEIGNS (27:1-12) 
###  David\'s doubt (27:1-4): Fearing that Saul will still try to kill him, David moves from Judah to the land of the Philistines. 
###  David\'s deceit (27:5-12) 
####  The facts (27:5-9): David and his men regularly raid the villages of pagan people living along the road to Egypt. 
####  The fiction (27:10-12): David leads King Achish of the Philistines to believe that he is raiding Israelite villages.

# ECCLESIASTES 6 
## FORTUNE DOES NOT BRING JOY (6:1-2). 
###  Most wealthy people are unhappy with their possessions in life (6:2a). 
###  All wealthy people leave their possessions to others in death (6:2b). 
## FAMILY DOES NOT BRING JOY (6:3-5): A stillborn child is better off than the unhappy father of 100 children. 
## FULLNESS OF YEARS DOES NOT BRING JOY (6:6-12): This is true even if a person could live to observe his or her 2000th birthday!

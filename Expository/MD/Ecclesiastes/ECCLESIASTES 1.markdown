# ECCLESIASTES 1 
## THE MAN (1:1, 12): The author introduces himself as King David\'s son-presumably Solomon-and notes that he once ruled over Israel. 
## THE MISSION (1:13, 16) 
###  His quest (1:13): Solomon devotes himself to searching out the purpose of life. 
###  His qualifications (1:16): Because of his great wisdom and power, Solomon feels he possesses the necessary credentials to conduct this search. 
## THE MADNESS (1:2-11, 14-15, 17-18): A preliminary investigation quickly reveals some bitter truths about life. 
###  No real purpose (1:2-7, 14, 17): Life is futile and meaningless. 
###  No new thing (1:9-10): History merely repeats itself. 
###  No cure (1:15): What is wrong cannot be righted. 
###  No lasting honour (1:11): The dead are quickly forgotten.

####  Listen to me, you wise men (34:1-4): Elihu calls for all who are wise to discern whether Job is right. 
####  Job is bitter and arrogant (34:5-9): Elihu accuses Job of being arrogant in his claim to be innocent. He believes that Job seeks the companionship of evil people. 
####  God repays people according to their deeds (34:10-32): This is why Elihu believes Job is arrogant. He argues that Job cannot be righteous, because he is suffering, and God does not unjustly punish the righteous and allow the wicked to go unpunished.

####  You cannot force God\'s hand (35:1-8): Elihu tells Job that he should not expect God to respond to him simply because Job is righteous. Our actions cannot force God to do anything. 
####  In God\'s good timing (35:9-16): The Almighty does indeed provide comfort for the oppressed, but all in his timing.

####  Who understands God\'s ways? (36:22-37:13): Elihu catalogues many wonders in nature that show God\'s greatness. In view of such greatness, how can Job tell God what to do?

######  The confrontation (40:6-41:34): The Lord asks Job if he is able to capture two fearful creatures. 
#######  The behemoth (40:15-24): It is difficult to be certain what this creature was. Some scholars believe it may have been a land dinosaur; others believe it was a hippopotamus. Whatever it was, it was very imposing. 
#######  The leviathan (41:1-34): Some scholars believe this mysterious creature may have been an aquatic dinosaur; others believe it might have been a crocodile.

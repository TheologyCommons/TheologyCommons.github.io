# Hebrews 7 
## A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE (7:1-3) 
###  The person of Melchizedek (7:1a, 2b-3) 
####  Who he was (7:2b): 
####  What he did (7:1a): 
####  Where he came from (7:3): 
###  The preeminence of Melchizedek (7:1b-2a) 
####  The battle (7:2a): 
####  The blessing (7:1b): 
## A THEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE (7:4-28): 
###  Royal (as was that of Melchizedek) (see 7:1) 
###  Superior (7:4-10) 
####  To whom? (7:5-7): To Levi, founder of the Levitical priesthood. 
####  Why? (7:4, 8-10) 
#####  Abraham was the ancestor of Levi (7:9). 
#####  The yet unborn Levi thus tithed to Melchizedek while still in the loins of Abraham (7:4, 8, 10). 
###  Independent (7:11-15) 
####  Independent of the law (7:11-12). 
####  Independent of the tribe of Levi (7:13-15): 
###  Everlasting (7:16-17)

###  Continuous (7:23) 
###  Permanent (7:24) 
###  Holy (7:26) 
###  All-sufficient (7:18-19, 25, 27)

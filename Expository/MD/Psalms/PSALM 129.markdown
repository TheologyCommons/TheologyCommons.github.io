# PSALM 129 
## THE PERSECUTION (129:1-4) 
###  Israel\'s enemies often attack (129:1-2). 
###  Israel\'s enemies can never annihilate her (129:2, 4). 
## THE PETITION (129:5-8) 
###  May Israel\'s enemies be defeated and disgraced, not receiving God\'s blessing (129:5, 8). 
###  May they dry up like grass, which is ignored by the harvester and despised by the binder (129:67).

# PSALM 124 
## THE WORST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS (124:1-5): 
###  The wicked would have swallowed Israel up (124:1-3). 
###  The waters would have engulfed Israel (124:4-5). 
## THE BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS (124:6-8): 
###  They are not torn apart by their foes! (124:6). 
###  They are delivered from their foes, as a bird escapes a hunter\'s trap (124:7-8).

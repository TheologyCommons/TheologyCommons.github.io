###  His meekness (10:1): 
###  His methodology (10:2-6)

####  What Paul does (10:4-6): 
###  His militancy (10:7-11) 
####  The ridicule (10:7a, 10): 
#####  He possesses no power or authority (10:7a). 
#####  He writes like a lion but in person is weak as a lamb (10:10). 
####  The response (10:7b-9, 11): 
#####  He possesses the power and authority of Christ himself (10:7b). 
#####  They will soon discover he is as a lion both in pen and in person (10:9, 11). 
###  His measure (10:12-13)

####  That he be allowed to preach the gospel to the regions beyond (10:16-17) 
####  That he be approved by God himself (10:18)

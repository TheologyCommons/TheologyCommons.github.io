# 2 CORINTHIANS 3 
## THE UNWRITTEN GRACE OF GOD (3:1-6) 
###  The Pharisees\' written letters of recommendation (3:1): 
###  The apostle\'s living letters of recommendation (3:2-6): 
## THE UNVEILED GLORY OF GOD (3:7-18): 
###  The law of Moses (3:7, 9a, 10a, 11a, 13-15) 
####  It was accompanied by a fading glory (3:7, 10a). 
####  It was temporary (3:11a). 
####  It led to death (3:9a). 
####  It functioned as a veil, restricting God\'s glory (3:13-14a, 15). 
####  It prevented Christlikeness in the lives of unsaved Jews and Gentiles (3:14b). 
###  The gospel of grace (3:8, 9b, 10b, 11b-12, 16-18) 
####  It is accompanied by an unfading glory (3:10b). 
####  It is eternal (3:11b). 
####  It leads to life (3:8). 
####  It functions as a mirror, reflecting God\'s glory (3:16-18). 
####  It produces Christlikeness in the lives of saved Jews and Gentiles (3:9b). 
####  It produces boldness (3:12).

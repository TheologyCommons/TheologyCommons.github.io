# ROMANS 9
## THE NINE SPIRITUAL ADVANTAGES OF THIS SOVEREIGN SELECTION (9:1-5) 
###  Paul\'s grief over Israel (9:1-3): 
###  God\'s gifts to Israel (9:4-5) 
####  They are a special nation (9:4a). 
####  They have been adopted by God (9:4b, 5). 
####  They have had God\'s glory revealed to them (9:4c). 
####  They have been given the covenants (9:4d). 
####  They have been given the law (9:4e). 
####  They have the privilege of worshiping him (9:4f). 
####  They have the messianic promises (9:4g). 
####  They have a godly ancestry (9:5a). 
####  They are the people from which Christ came (9:5b). 
## THE FIVE PERSONAL EXAMPLES OF THIS SOVEREIGN SELECTION (9:6-29) 
###  The example of Ishmael and Isaac (9:6-10): 
###  The example of Esau and Jacob (9:11-13) 
####  What God did (9:12b-13): 
####  When God did it (9:11a, 12a): 
####  Why God did it (9:11b): 
###  The example of Pharaoh (9:14-24) 
####  The facts involved (9:15-18) 
#####  God determined to pardon sinful Israel with undeserved grace (9:15-16). 
#####  God determined to punish sinful Pharaoh with deserved judgment (9:17-18). 
####  The fairness involved (9:14, 19-24) 
#####  In light of this, is God righteous? Yes! (9:14, 21-24). 
######  As a potter creates vessels, God creates nations (9:14, 21-22). 
######  As a potter controls those vessels, God controls nations (9:23-24). 
#####  In light of this, is man responsible? Yes! (9:19-20): 
###  The example from Hosea (9:25-26): 
###  The example from Isaiah (9:27-29): 
####  Out of the millions of Israelites, only a small remnant will be saved (Isa. 10:22-23) (9:27-28). 
####  Even the remnant would perish apart from the grace of God (Isa. 1:9) (9:29). 
## THE TWO GRAND CONCLUSIONS CONCERNING THIS SOVEREIGN SELECTION (9:30-33) 
###  Through faith the Gentiles have found righteousness without even seeking it (9:30). 
###  Through the law Israel has not found righteousness even after seeking it (9:31-33). 
####  The seeking (9:31-32): 
####  The stumbling (9:33):

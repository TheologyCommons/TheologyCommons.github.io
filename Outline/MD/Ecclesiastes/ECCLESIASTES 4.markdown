# ECCLESIASTES 4 
## THE WRETCHED THINGS IN THIS LIFE (4:1-8, 13-16) 
###  The people Solomon finds (4:1, 4-8) 
####  The oppressed poor (4:1) 
####  The selfish rich (4:4, 7-8) 
####  The lazy fool (4:5-6) 
###  The pessimism Solomon feels (4:2-3, 13-16) 
####  Concerning life and death (4:2-3) 
#####  It is better to be dead than living (4:2)! 
#####  It is best never to have been born (4:3)! 
####  Concerning prisoners and potentates (4:13-16) 
#####  It is better to be a poor but wise youth with a prison record than to be a rich but foolish king (4:13-16a)! 
#####  However, in the final analysis, it matters little who and what one is (4:16b). 
## THE WORKABLE THINGS IN THIS LIFE (4:9-12) 
###  Two are better than one (4:9-12a). 
####  If one falls, the other can help (4:10). 
####  If one is cold, the other can provide warmth (4:11). 
####  If one is attacked, the other can defend (4:12a). 
###  Three are better than two (4:12b): A triple-braided cord is not easily broken.

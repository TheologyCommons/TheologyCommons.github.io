## SAUL\'S FOES (14:1-23): Saul camps outside Gibeah, but Jonathan and his armor bearer attack the enemy by themselves and initiate a great victory! 
###  The strategy (14:1-8): Jonathan and his armor bearer attempt to single-handedly defeat an entire Philistine garrison! 
###  The success (14:11-23) 
####  The courage (14:11-14): Jonathan and his armor bearer kill 20 Philistines while scaling a cliff! 
####  The confusion (14:15-23): The Lord sends an earthquake, throwing the Philistines into terrified panic. 
## SAUL\'S FAST (14:24-46): To assure full revenge on his enemies, Saul had forced his men to vow that they would not eat anything that day, so they were worn out.

###  The rendezvous (15:12-13): Saul and Samuel meet on the morning following the battle with King Agag. 
###  The rebuke (15:14-23): Samuel condemns Saul\'s disobedience, refusing to accept his miserable excuse that he saved the animals so he can sacrifice them to God. He tells Saul that the Lord has rejected him as king. 
###  The remorse (15:24-25): Saul admits his sin and begs Samuel to forgive him and give him another chance.

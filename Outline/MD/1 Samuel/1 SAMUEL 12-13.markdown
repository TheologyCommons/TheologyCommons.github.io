###  Saul\'s wickedness (13:1-14) 
####  The panic (13:1-7): Saul\'s son Jonathan and his army destroy the garrison of Philistines at Geba, so the enemy mobilizes its entire army of chariots, horsemen, and soldiers against Israel. Saul and his men tremble in fear at the sight! 
####  The presumption (13:8-9): To rally his frightened troops, Saul unlawfully assumes the role of priest and offers up the burnt offering. 
####  The punishment (13:10-14): Samuel arrives and rebukes Saul for his actions. He pronounces that the Lord will punish Saul by ending his dynasty. 
###  Israel\'s weakness (13:15-23) 
####  Lack of warriors (13:15): Saul\'s army dwindles to only 600 men. 
####  Lack of weapons (13:16-23): There are no blacksmiths in all Israel, so the only soldiers who have a sword or spear are Saul and Jonathan!
